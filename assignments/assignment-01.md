# Assignment 01

**Group members**
- First member student's name (student ID number) (number of problem that you solve)
- Second member student's name (student ID number) (1)
- Third member student's name (stuednt ID number) (2, 4)
- etc.


## Problem 1
Show that, with `num_friends` data, if you remove the outlier, the central 
tendencies using median is more stable than using mean.  

**Hint**: Remove the outlier and calculate how far it changes for the medians or
mean. Compare their distance and draw a conclusion

## Problem 2
Decide that old saying "having many children bring prosperity" is true or false
by calculating the correlation from the following datasets:
- [Percentage of Households by Province, Sex of Household Headed and Number of Household Members, 2009-2023](https://www.bps.go.id/en/statistics-table/1/MTYwMyMx/persentase-rumah-tangga-menurut-provinsi--jenis-kelamin-kepala-rumah-tangga--dan-banyaknya-anggota-rumah-tangga--2009-2023.html)
- [National Income of Indonesia 2018-2022
](https://www.bps.go.id/en/publication/2023/06/12/c8c6ec7f9b9688e1207e1b56/pendapatan-nasional-indonesia-2018-2022.html) page 184 - Appendix 1. Section K.2 (Insurance and Pension Fund)

## Problem 3
Bayes's theorem is a fundamental theorem in probability that has a greater
impact to many branch of sciences. The formula is simple but understanding
Bayes's theorem is not an easy task. In this problem, you have to watch
the re-inventing Bayes's theorem by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lG4VkPoG3ko) YouTube channel.
Explan the "veredicial paradox" which is related to the medical test paradox.
Provide with the example. You can use the example from the video or other 
examples.


## Problem 4
Show numerically with an experiment that central limit theorem
holds for a different distribution where the population mean is estimated.
Use beta distribution as your population distribution.   

**Hint**:
- Generate a random number, from beta distribution
- Get a mean, and redo the experiement for $n$ trials
- Show that when you increase $n$, the mean of sample tends to normal distribution.
