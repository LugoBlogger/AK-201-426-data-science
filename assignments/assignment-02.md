## Problem 2

Watch the following video related to $p$-value by StatQuest with Josh Stamer:

and how to interpret it. Why is the common rejection of $p$-value is less 
than 0.05. What is the consequence if we use smaller rejection criterion
such as 0.01 or 0.005?

## Problem 3

Using the data from `datasets/dim-reduc-2d.csv`, perform gradient descent
with a linear model $y = \text{slope}\times x + \text{intercept}$
to find out the best estimation for the slope and intercept.
