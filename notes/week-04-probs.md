# Notes - Week 04 - Short review of probability 

Lecturer: **Henokh Lugo Hariyanto**

> The tips for learning how to code with Python for this lecture is you should 
> rewrite all the codes. After that you should play around by modifying all 
> the values, input parameters, and other settings. By looking at the behavior 
> of after you re run the program for several times, you should understand the 
> mechanism and functionality of each code in a part of whole program.

This note is short version and summary of (Gruz, 2019). Most of the codes and 
texts are excerpt from that book.

## Dependence and independence events

## Conditional probability
$$
  P(E|F) = \frac{P(E,F)}{P(F)}
$$

## Bayes's theorem

$$
  P(E|F) = \frac{P(F|E) P(E)}{P(F)}
$$

## Random variables

## Continuous distribution

## Normal distribution

## The central limit theorem
