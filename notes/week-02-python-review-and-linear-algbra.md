# Notes - Week 02 - Python basics and linear algreba 

Lecturer: **Henokh Lugo Hariyanto**

> The tips for learning how to code with Python for this lecture is you should 
> rewrite all the codes. After that you should play around by modifying all 
> the values, input parameters, and other settings. By looking at the behavior 
> of after you re run the program for several times, you should understand the 
> mechanism and functionality of each code in a part of whole program.

This note is short version and summary of (Gruz, 2019). Most of the codes and 
texts are excerpt from that book.

## Python basics

Please kindly read and understand the notebook [ch-02-py-crash-course.ipynb](../ch-01-intro.ipynb) or chapter 2 in (Grus, 2019) for the basics
Python that we will use for the entire course, and also
[ch-04-linear-algebra.ipynb](../ch-04-linear-algebra.ipynb)

This short tutorial is not a replacement for a complete description of 
Python. I do not intend to make it such that the reader will understand
all the basic concepts. This is a review, and you should consult
the standard book in Python such as [(Severance, 2024) - Python for Everybody](https://do1.dr-chuck.com/pythonlearn/EN_us/pythonlearn.pdf)

The following topics are covered in [ch-02-py-crash-course.ipynb](../ch-01-intro.ipynb):

## Linear Algebra

In this tutorial, we explore the implementation of the mathematical
objects vectors and matrices. We also learn how to define the type
of `Vector` and `Matrix` using the module `typing`.

The rest of this section is to develop all the operation involving
vector and matrices. In the end we hope we learn how to translate
the mathematical object into Python programming language efficiently.

There is a library dedicated to this topic and so popular to manipulate
high dimensinal array, which is called [`numpy`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable). You have to consult
the documentation if you want to know more.
